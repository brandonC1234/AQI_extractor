# AQI_extractor

This is a simple python notebook that outputs the average US AQI given a dataset of local measurements

The original dataset is found here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/calebreigada/us-air-quality-1980present

**Since the dataset is too big to easily upload to github, I created a very stripped down version that barely fit into the 100MB upload limit to put in the github.**
